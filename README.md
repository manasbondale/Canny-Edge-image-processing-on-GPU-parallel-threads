**Canny Edge Detection Algorithm on GPU: Readme**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains an implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using GPU parallel programming in C++. Canny Edge Detection is a popular image processing technique used for edge detection in images. This implementation leverages the parallel processing power of the GPU to accelerate the computation of edge detection.
\
**Implementation Details:**
- The algorithm is implemented using CUDA, which allows for parallel execution of the edge detection process.
- The edge detection steps, including Gaussian blurring, gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and edge tracking by hysteresis, are parallelized to take advantage of the GPU's computational power.
- Input images are transferred to the GPU memory for processing, and the resulting edge-detected images are transferred back to the host memory.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, CMake).
3. Ensure that CUDA is properly configured in your development environment.
4. Compile and build the project.
5. Run the executable, providing input images as arguments.

**Performance Considerations:**
- The performance of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm on GPU depends on factors such as the GPU's architecture, memory bandwidth, and the size of the input image.
- Experiment with different block sizes, grid sizes, and optimization techniques to maximize performance.
- Profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight can be used to analyze the performance of the GPU kernel and identify potential bottlenecks.
